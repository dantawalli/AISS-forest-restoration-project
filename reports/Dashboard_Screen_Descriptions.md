# Dashboard Screen Descriptions

This document provides detailed descriptions of each screen in the Forest Watch Dashboard application. Each section corresponds to a screenshot that will be attached to the report.

## Main Dashboard Overview

The main dashboard interface presents a comprehensive view of global forest monitoring data, featuring a clean and intuitive layout designed for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. At the top of the screen, three prominent summary cards display key performance indicators: the total number of countries in the dataset, cumulative tree cover loss in hectares from 2001 to 2024 (filtered to ≥30% canopy threshold), and total carbon emissions in megagrams of CO₂ equivalent over the same period. Below these cards, interactive filtering controls allow users to select a specific country from a dropdown menu and adjust the year range using a slider that spans from 2001 to the latest available data year. The dashboard employs a tabbed navigation system, enabling users to explore different aspects of forest data through six distinct views: About & SDG Context, Animated Map, Loss Trends, Deforestation Drivers, Carbon & Climate Impact, and Predictions. The interface follows Material Design principles with a clean white background, subtle shadows, and a cohesive color palette that enhances readability and user experience.

## About & SDG Context Tab

The About & SDG Context tab serves as an informational hub that provides essential background information about the project, its objectives, and its alignment with global sustainability goals. This screen presents a structured overview section that explains the dashboard's origin as part of the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's in Artificial Intelligence for Sustainable Societies (AISS) program, specifically within the Introduction to Data Science course. The tab details the project's primary objective of exploring forest degradation, primary forest loss, and carbon flux dynamics over time, while identifying the human and natural drivers contributing most significantly to deforestation. It comprehensively lists the data sources, including Global Forest Watch country-level datasets spanning 2001 to 2024, and acknowledges the University of Maryland GLAD Laboratory and Google as the original data providers (Hansen et al., 2013). The screen explicitly highlights the project's alignment with Sustainable Development Goals, particularly SDG 15 (Life on Land) for monitoring deforestation and forest restoration progress, and SDG 13 (Climate Action) for analyzing CO₂ emissions from forest loss. A methodology summary outlines the technical approach, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, regression modeling using Random Forest, and the development of the interactive Dash application. The tab concludes with academic references and attribution to the project developers, presented in a professional, card-based layout with appropriate spacing and typography.

## Animated Map Tab (2001–2024)

The Animated Map tab presents a dynamic, interactive choropleth visualization of global tree cover loss, enabling users to observe temporal changes in forest degradation across countries from 2001 to 2024. This screen features a world map projection using Plotly's natural earth projection, where each country is color-coded according to its annual tree cover loss in hectares, with a color scale ranging from light yellow (low loss) to deep red (high loss). The map includes an integrated animation control that allows users to play, pause, and scrub through years using a timeline slider, creating a time-lapse effect that reveals patterns of deforestation acceleration, stabilization, or decline in different regions over the 24-year period. Countries with missing data appear in neutral gray tones, while the color intensity directly corresponds to the magnitude of tree cover loss, providing an immediate visual understanding of global hotspots and trends. The map interface includes hover functionality that displays precise loss values when users move their cursor over specific countries, and the animation frame clearly indicates the currently displayed year. This visualization is particularly effective for identifying regional patterns, understanding the geographic distribution of forest loss, and observing how deforestation has evolved globally, making it a powerful tool for comparative analysis and stakeholder presentations.

## Loss Trends Tab

The Loss Trends tab displays a detailed time series analysis of tree cover loss for the selected country, filtered to the standard 30% canopy threshold. This screen presents a line chart with markers that plots annual tree cover loss in hectares on the y-axis against years on the x-axis, allowing users to identify trends, peaks, and patterns in deforestation over the selected time range. The chart uses a clean, minimalist design with a blue color scheme (#2E86AB) that emphasizes data clarity, featuring a solid line with circular markers at each data point to highlight individual year values. The visualization automatically updates based on the country selection from the main dashboard filter and respects the year range specified by the slider, enabling users to focus on specific time periods of interest. The chart includes hover tooltips that display exact values when users interact with data points, and the layout incorporates subtle grid lines and axis labels that follow Material Design guidelines for enhanced readability. This screen is essential for understanding historical deforestation trajectories, identifying periods of accelerated loss, recognizing seasonal or cyclical patterns, and comparing loss rates across different timeframes. The visualization helps stakeholders assess whether deforestation is increasing, decreasing, or stabilizing in a given country, providing critical insights for policy development and conservation planning.

## Deforestation Drivers Tab

The Deforestation Drivers tab provides a comprehensive breakdown of the various factors contributing to tree cover loss in the selected country, offering insights into the root causes of deforestation. This screen presents a horizontal or vertical bar chart where each bar represents a different driver category, with bar lengths proportional to the total hectares of forest loss attributed to that driver over the selected time period. The drivers include hard commodities (such as palm oil, soy, and cattle ranching), logging activities, wildfires, permanent agriculture, shifting cultivation, settlements and infrastructure development, and other natural disturbances. Each driver is assigned a distinct color from a carefully curated palette that follows Material Design principles, making it easy to distinguish between categories at a glance. The chart displays values both visually through bar lengths and numerically through text labels, and includes hover interactions that provide additional detail. This visualization is filtered to the 30% canopy threshold to ensure consistency with other dashboard components, and it automatically aggregates data across all years in the selected range to show cumulative driver contributions. The screen is particularly valuable for understanding the primary causes of deforestation in specific regions, enabling policymakers, conservation organizations, and researchers to target interventions more effectively. By identifying whether deforestation is primarily driven by agricultural expansion, commodity production, infrastructure development, or natural factors, stakeholders can develop more targeted and effective forest conservation strategies.

## Carbon & Climate Impact Tab

The Carbon & Climate Impact tab visualizes the relationship between tree cover loss and carbon emissions, providing critical insights into the climate consequences of deforestation. This screen presents a scatter plot where each point represents a data point for the selected country and time range, with tree cover loss in hectares plotted on the x-axis and carbon emissions in megagrams of CO₂ equivalent on the y-axis. The points are color-coded by year using a continuous color scale (Viridis), allowing users to observe temporal trends in the loss-emission relationship, with earlier years typically appearing in darker colors and more recent years in brighter hues. A linear trendline fitted using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression overlays the scatter points, providing a visual representation of the overall correlation between forest loss and carbon release. The visualization includes hover functionality that displays exact values for both loss and emissions, enabling precise data exploration. This screen is essential for understanding the climate impact of deforestation, as it demonstrates how different magnitudes of forest loss translate into carbon emissions, which directly contribute to global warming. The trendline helps identify whether the relationship is consistent over time or if there are changes in carbon density or emission factors. This visualization supports SDG 13 (Climate Action) by quantifying the climate consequences of forest degradation, making it a valuable tool for carbon accounting, climate policy development, and understanding the environmental cost of deforestation activities.

## Predictions Tab

The Predictions tab leverages machine learning models to forecast future tree cover loss, providing stakeholders with forward-looking insights for planning and intervention strategies. This screen features an interactive interface with dropdown controls for selecting a target country and a future year (extending up to 10 years beyond the latest available data), allowing users to generate customized predictions. The screen displays the predicted tree cover loss value prominently in a highlighted box, along with contextual information such as the historical average loss for the selected country and the percentage change from that average, helping users interpret the prediction in relation to past trends. Below the prediction summary, a comprehensive trend chart visualizes both historical data (displayed as a solid blue line with markers) and predicted values (shown as a dashed red line with diamond markers), creating a clear visual distinction between observed and forecasted data. A vertical reference line marks the boundary between historical and predicted periods, labeled with the last available data year. The target year prediction is highlighted with a star-shaped marker in a distinct color, drawing attention to the specific forecast of interest. The machine learning model underlying these predictions uses a Random Forest algorithm trained on historical data, incorporating features such as year, deforestation drivers, carbon emissions, primary forest loss, and other relevant variables. The predictions are generated through linear extrapolation of key features combined with the trained model's learned patterns, providing a data-driven approach to forecasting. This screen is particularly valuable for scenario planning, policy development, and resource allocation, as it enables stakeholders to anticipate future deforestation trends and plan conservation interventions proactively.
